# Mystery Word Game (Wordle-style)

 A fun terminal game where you have **6 tries** to guess a randomly selected **5-letter mystery word**. After each guess, you'll get helpful hints:
-  Uppercase: correct letter in the correct position
-  Lowercase: correct letter but in the wrong position
-  Underscore: letter not in the word

- The game picks a **random word** from a predefined list.
- You enter a 5-letter word as your guess.
- The program gives you feedback after every guess.
- You have **6 chances** to guess the word correctly.
